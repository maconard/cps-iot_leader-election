Master node .elf files are named "master-node_platform_topology.elf"

Example: m3 board for tree would be named "master-node_m3_tree.elf"

Worker node .elf files are named "worker-node_platform_K-T1-T2.elf"

T1 and T2 are in milliseconds, i.e. 2 seconds is 2000.

Example: m3 board with K=5, T1=2.25, T2=2.00 would be named "worker-node_m3_5-2250-2000.elf"
