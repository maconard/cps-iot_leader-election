Master node .elf files are named "master_platform_topology.elf"

Example: m3 board for tree would be named "master_iotlab-m3_tree.elf"

Worker node .elf files are named "worker_platform_K-T1-T2.elf"

Note: T1 and T2 are in seconds.

Example: m3 board with K=5, T1=2.25, T2=2.00 would be named "worker_iotlab-m3_5-2_25-2.elf"
